# Testing and training FOG dataset to get the best model for Object Detection and Classification With YOLOv8

## Introduction
This project is a part of the final project of the Smart India Hackathon at the Nalla Malla Engineering College. The goal of this project is to train and test the FOG dataset to get the best model for object detection and classification with YOLOv8. The dataset is divided into 2 parts: training and testing. The training dataset contains 1000 images and the testing dataset contains 200 images. The dataset is annotated with the bounding boxes of the objects.

## Dataset
The dataset is available at [FOG Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yKHIH9dQTV96437nJGWJO8Uq-4eIMoOV)

## Training
The training is done using the YOLOv8 model. The model is trained for 300 epochs
